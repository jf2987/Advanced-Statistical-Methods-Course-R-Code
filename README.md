# Advanced-Statistical-Methods-Course-R-Code

This is code I created from a Advanced Statistical Analysis Graduate course at Sacramento State University. This course helped us understand conceptually through SPSS and Excel Advanced Statistical Concepts. I applied this conceptual understanding, and replicated the couse assignements with R code.
